        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

        Give me freedom,
        Give me fire,
        Give me reason,
        Take me higher.

        See the champions
        Take the field now.
        Unify us,
        Make us feel proud.

        In the streets our
        Heads are liftin'
        As we lose our
        Inhibition.

        Celebration.
        It surrounds us.
        Every nation.
        All around us.

        Staying forever young,
        Singin' songs underneath the sun.
        Let's rejoice in the beautiful game.
        And together at the end of the day,
        We all say,

        When I get older,
        I will be stronger,
        They'll call me "Freedom",
        Just like a wavin' flag.

        When I get older,
        I will be stronger,
        They'll call me "Freedom",
        Just like a wavin' flag.

        So, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.

        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

        Give you freedom,
        Give you fire,
        Give you reason,
        Take you higher.

        See the champions
        Take the field now.
        Unify us,
        Make us feel proud.

        In the streets our
        Heads are liftin'
        As we lose our
        Inhibition.

        Celebration.
        It surrounds us.
        Every nation.
        All around us.

        Staying forever young,
        Singin' songs underneath the sun.
        Let's rejoice in the beautiful game.
        And together at the end of the day,
        We all say,

        When I get older,
        I will be stronger,
        They'll call me "Freedom",

        So, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.

        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.

        Now, wave your flag.
        Now, wave your flag.

        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
        And everybody will be singin' it.
        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
        And we all will be singin' it.
